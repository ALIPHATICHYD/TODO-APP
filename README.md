# Getting Started with Create React App

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

* Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
* A GitHub account.
* A web hosting service where you can deploy your React app (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

# Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

* Go to the GitHub repository that contains your React app.
* Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository's URL.
* Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
* Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
* Run the following command to clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```
* Replace <repository-url> with the URL you copied in step 2.


# Step 2: Install Dependencies

* Navigate to the cloned repository's directory using the terminal or command prompt.
* Run the following command to install the app's dependencies:
```
npm install
```

# Step 3: Run the React App Locally
* After the dependencies are installed, run the following command to build the React app:
```
npm start
```
* Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
