### Internship Assessment

## Objective

The objective of this technical assessment is to evaluate your proficiency in building JavaScript applications using ReactJS. For this assessment you will be required to build a simple todo application using local storage as your database to persist data.

## Requirements

- The application should allow users to add, and delete tasks.
- Tasks should have a title, description, and status (completed or not).
- The status should be toggleable.
- Additionally, the application should persist data using LocalStorage (refer to this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) for the definition of LocalStorage).
- Kindly focus on the ‘functionality’ rather than UI.
- The application should be built using ReactJS using CodeSandbox (link to CodeSandbox [here](https://codesandbox.io/)).
- Please ensure that your CodeSandbox link is public and accessible.

## Timeframe

You will have 72 hours to complete the assessment.

## Assessment Criteria

You will be assessed based on the following criteria:

- Code quality (clean, concise, maintainable)
- Functionality (all requirements met)
- User experience (easy to use and visually appealing)
- Best practices (proper use of ReactJS and LocalStorage)

## Submission

Kindly submit their CodeSandbox link [here](https://forms.gle/Ebn5jM3mTVcQzFyY7) channel before the deadline.

Good luck! If you have any questions please send a mail to hello@webboss.tech


# Getting Started with Create React App

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

* Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
* A GitHub account.
* A web hosting service where you can deploy your React app (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

# Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

* Go to the GitHub repository that contains your React app.
* Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository's URL.
* Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
* Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
* Run the following command to clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```
* Replace <repository-url> with the URL you copied in step 2.


# Step 2: Install Dependencies

* Navigate to the cloned repository's directory using the terminal or command prompt.
* Run the following command to install the app's dependencies:
```
npm install
```

# Step 3: Run the React App Locally
* After the dependencies are installed, run the following command to build the React app:
```
npm start
```
* Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.


# Step 4: Choose a Hosting Service

* Select a web hosting service where you want to deploy your React app. Some popular options are Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages.
* Sign up for an account on the chosen hosting service if you haven't already.
* Step 5: Deploy to the Hosting Service

* Follow the hosting service's documentation to deploy your React app.
* Generally, the process involves connecting your GitHub repository to the hosting service and configuring the deployment settings.
* Ensure that you specify the build folder (created in step 3) as the deployment source.

# Step 6: Access Your Deployed React App

* Once the deployment process is complete, the hosting service will provide you with a URL where your React app is hosted.
* Open a web browser and enter the URL to access your deployed React app.

# Conclusion:
* Congratulations! You have successfully run and hosted your React app from a GitHub repository. Users can now access your app through the provided URL.
* Remember to update your repository and redeploy whenever you make changes to your React app.
